# NMM-Compliment-Poster
Inspired by the random light-up compliment poster by Evan and Katelyn on YouTube! I didn't have the materials or equipment to make the same setup that they did, so I decided to make a virtual one instead! Generate those compliments!

### NMM has upgraded! I actually sort of learned how to make exe files and installers so now there is a fancy new installer you can download! Yay!

### Unfortunately, the installer and .zip file were too big to upload to GitHub. Whoops! I'll have to work on cutting those file sizes down. Not to worry though! You can still download the installer or .zip file from the link below.

### Installer: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10n6Vs3ltB4EhLUArP6x58PwUvrXHQXjf/view?usp=sharing
### .zip File: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y1TPa5ZFNJaMO2xSJvuYJ_EnsGZ5ZGbY/view?usp=sharing

- I'll leave the actual python code in this repository, but it's really just there if you want to mess around with it.

- The installer will NOT generate a desktop shortcut automatically so please make sure to go to the installation path and make a desktop shortcut if you want one. The default installation path is under C://Program Files (x86)/NMMComplimentPoster. Just navigate to that folder and right click the application file and select send to desktop (shortcut). There are a lot of files in that folder! I promise that the application file (it should be a .exe file) is somewhere in there!

- Your browser and computer will both probably try to warn you that the installer is not to be trusted. Yes I am not a known app publisher. No my installer will not kill your computer. I promise.

- If for some reason the installer isn't working for you, you can download the .zip file and extract the program that way.

- Everytime you close the program, you'll probably get some kind of error message saying that the program failed to run. But it did run. I don't know why it does this. It shouldn't affect anything.

### Just click that Compliment Me! button for those sweet E&K inspired compliments!

- The window should be resizable, and the content should dynamically change depending on the size (that is if my coding is not terrible). 

- If the page contents do not resize with the page, just resize again and it should correct itself.

### Known Issues that I'm Working On:

- There's a slight ghosting issue when you generate a new compliment after resizing the window. I'm still working on fixing that. It shows up on screen recordings more so than in real life for some reason.

- Resizing the window again after generating the compliment gets rid of the ghosting.

## If you use my code to do something fun or cool, share it with me! Also, credit is nice to have too.
## Enjoy!
